== Frequently Asked Questions ==

- Is there anything else required?
Yes, you will need to install the “Redux framework” plugin to view the settings page.  Also needed are api keys from Moz and Google Page Insights.  [We have instructions](https://greenjaymedia.com/wp-site-auditor/how-to-get-api-keys/) on how to get the api keys.


- Why do I need api keys?
The plugin gathers data from various sources to show in a report.  The api keys are needed to check the seo scores from the sources.

- Any other costs?
No. The Google Page Insights API is free, the moz API is free also. Redux framework plugin is free also.

You can purchase the premium version of the plugin for extra features, which is optional.

- Can I export my leads?
The freemius version does not store leads. The [premium version](https://greenjaymedia.com/wp-site-auditor/) has the option to save leads, view lead details, contact them, and export to CSV.
